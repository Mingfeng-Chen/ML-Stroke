# ML-Stroke

This is the course project of machine learning offered by THU. Our chosen project is stroke prediction.

stroke.py and heart_diease.py is used for data prepocessing.

train.py is used for training XGBoost and cross-validation on original PCA selected features.

train_heart.py is used for training XGBoost and cross-validation on original PCA selected features + heart_diease features.  

param_selection.py and param_selection_heart.py are used for hyper-parameter search.

vis.ipynb is used for visualization of XGBoost and feature correlations.  

feature_corr.png , tree.png and xgboost.png are pictures used to show the results.  

Course Project Report.pdf is the document that reports the process and results of the experiment.  

test_pred.csv is the prediction result on the test set.
